revamp level 1 and add first aid item
, and checking remaining bug.

Bugs that still not fixed.
- player transform flickering and clipping out by colliding or moving a while. adding physics mat still can't fix the problem(PlayerController.cs)
- door not open while enemy that have navmesh agent got in the zone that provided (DoorAiTrigger.cs)
- puzzle, when true pattern doesn't return bool right (LevelPuzzle.cs)
everthing is in the script file
